Part 1 – Coding 
Train two CNN models with GPU in Google Colab: 

One is defined by you with a few restrictions and be trained from scratch, save it as age_gender_A.h5 
The other is to fine-tune a pre-trained model, save it as age_gender_B.h5 
Full details can be found in the Google Colab Notebook file. Your models will be subject to testing on unseen test data. 

Part 2 – Report

Section 1: Introduction
Give a brief description of what this assignment is about.

Section 2: My own CNN 
Architecture. What is your CNN architecture? What is the reason for it? How many parameters are there?
Training. How did you set the relevant hyperparameters? What is the reason for them? How long does the model train on each epoch? How long does the whole training take with GPU? Screenshot a part of the training output.
Performance. Display the four figures of learning curves and give a brief description of them.

Section 3: Pre-trained CNN
Architecture. Which pre-trained CNN are you using? How did you transfer learn based on this pre-trained CNN? What is the reason for it? How many parameters are in total and how many are trained? 
Training. How did you set the relevant hyperparameters? What is the reason for them? How long does the model train on each epoch? How long does the whole training take with GPU? Screenshot a part of the training output. 
Performance. Display the four figures of learning curves and give a brief description of them.

Section 4: Summary and Discussion
Compare the two models. What do you achieve in doing this assignment? Any other discussion you would like to have.
